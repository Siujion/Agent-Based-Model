The following is a set of code for agent based modelling, where an environment
and agents are created. This model is used to animate the rate of how the 
invasive crazy yellow ants (agents) move around eating and altering 
a new ecosystem (environment) they find. They continue to move and destroy
the ecosystem until the conditions are unfavourable
i.e an increase in temperature and they die (stopping condition).
The last bit of code, produces a graphic user interface. When the 
code is run, a new interface appears with a menu that allows
a user to click "Run Model" to view the animation.

The model text is also accompanied by an agent framework which is
a blueprint of the agents behaviour. Also, a text file is included
which contains raster data that creates the environment.
